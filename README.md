# DataStructureDecode
# Data Structures Implementations

This repository contains practical implementations of fundamental *Data Structure* concepts, 
applied in *three different programming languages*:

- 🟦 C#
- 🐍 Python
- 🟦 C++

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice and strengthen understanding of *core data structures*.
- Compare implementation details across different programming languages.
- Build a reference for learning and future projects.

## 📂 Structure
Each language has its own folder containing implementations of the same data structures, for example:
## 🚀 Data Structures Covered
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs  
(and more as the course progresses)
